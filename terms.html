 <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>
 <h3>1. Service Availability</h3>
 <p>TCS Towing operates nationwide across South Africa, subject to road access, legal restrictions, and safety conditions at the pickup and destination.</p>
 <h3>2. Quotes & Pricing</h3>
 <p>Call-out fee applies. Quotes are provided based on distance, vehicle type, service complexity, and any abnormal-load requirements. No fixed prices are displayed on this website.</p>
 <h3>3. Deposit Policy</h3>
 <p>Deposit amount will be confirmed during booking based on distance, vehicle type, and service complexity. The customer will be contacted for deposit confirmation before dispatch. Deposits are processed via secure payment channels (e.g., PayFast or EFT) and become non-refundable once dispatch is initiated.</p>
 <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
 <p>Balance is payable upon service completion. Accepted methods include PayFast, EFT, and cash, where applicable. Proof of payment must be provided for EFTs before dispatch if required.</p>
 <h3>5. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
 <p>The customer must provide accurate pickup and destination details, disclose vehicle condition, and ensure safe access for towing and recovery teams.</p>
 <h3>6. Liability & Delays</h3>
 <p>While every effort is made to respond promptly, TCS Towing is not liable for delays caused by traffic, weather, road closures, or third-party incidents. Vehicle handling is performed with professional care; TCS Towing is not responsible for pre-existing damage or mechanical faults.</p>
 <h3>7. Cancellation</h3>
 <p>Cancellations must be requested before dispatch. Once dispatch has started, the deposit is forfeited and call-out may be charged.</p>
 <h3>8. Privacy</h3>
 <p>Customer details collected via the booking form are used for dispatch and operational communication only and may be logged to internal systems (e.g., Google Sheets) for service delivery.</p>
